#### Bug Fixes
- [CAF-3352](https://jira.autonomy.com/browse/CAF-3352): Not condition children underneath Not conditions could not be edited.
  When a Not condition was created with `condition` set to another Not condition it was not possible to edit the next level of conditions being negated. This has been fixed to allow Rule and Action Condition API calls to retrieve conditions at all levels in the Not chain.
- [CAF-3350](https://jira.autonomy.com/browse/CAF-3350): Removal of 'fragment' and 'text' conditions from processing API contract.
  The condition types 'fragment' and 'text' have been removed from the swagger contract for the processing API. Logic behind this is that fragment conditions are too complex to expose to users and text conditions require the processing API to have access to a running Elasticsearch instance which the default Data Processing deployment does not enable for the processing API.
